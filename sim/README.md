# dsp-codesign

An example design, portover, and verification of a FIR filter, from desktop simulation environment (iPython), to a C implementation, to running and verifying on actual microcontroller hardware. 

Includes:

- iPython / Jupyter notebook for generating and simulating the FIR filter
- C implementation of FIR filter, with checks against Jupyter model
- embedded port of C implementation, on an STM32 microcontroller
